## Why?

- To provide an easy to follow, step-by-step guide to help you understand the intricacies of the 42 - B2BR Project.

## Recommended Methodology

The main goal of this guide is for it to serve as a starting point for you to conduct an indepth research in regards to each step presented.
If you intend to follow this guide, I highly recommend the following methodology in order for you to get the most out of it.
For every part of this guide, you will be introduced to specific commands.

	1. Google the command and read the documentation for each one. The idea is to get   a general understanding of what the command does.
	2. Try the command outside of the project. Open a terminal and try typing the command and see what value or information it retruns.
	3. Take notes: When reading the doc, make sure to summarize what you understood for each command. Make a short description of what the command does and how it is used.
	4. Do not move to the next step of this guide if you are not comfortable with the current one.
