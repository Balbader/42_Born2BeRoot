# 42 - Born 2 Be Root

You will create your first machine in VirtualBox (or UTM if you can’t use VirtualBox) under specific instructions. Then, at the end of this project, you will be able to set up your own operating system while implementing strict rules.

## General Guidelines

• The use of VirtualBox (or UTM if you can’t use VirtualBox) is mandatory.<br>
• You only have to turn in a signature.txt file at the root of your repository. You must paste in it the signature of your machine’s virtual disk. Go to Submission and peer-evaluation for more information.<br>
